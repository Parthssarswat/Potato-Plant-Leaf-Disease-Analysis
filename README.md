# Potato Leaf Disease Analysis

This repository contains the code, data, and models for detecting and classifying various diseases in potato leaves using machine learning techniques. The project aims to help farmers and agricultural professionals quickly identify diseases in potato crops to prevent crop losses.

## Overview

Potato crops are susceptible to several types of leaf diseases, which can significantly impact yield if not treated early. This project implements a solution to classify diseases from images of potato leaves using deep learning models, helping automate the disease detection process.

### Key Features:
- Image classification for multiple potato leaf diseases.
- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image recognition.
- Jupyter notebooks for training, testing, and evaluating the model.
- Scripts for model deployment and inference on new images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of potato leaves with different diseases, including:
- Early Blight
- Late Blight
- Healthy

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/potato-disease) or use your own dataset in the same structure.

### Dataset Structure:
```
/data
    /train
        /Early_Blight
        /Late_Blight
        /Healthy
    /test
        /Early_Blight
        /Late_Blight
        /Healthy
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/potato-leaf-disease-analysis.git
   cd potato-leaf-disease-analysis
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. Place the dataset in the `data/` folder as shown in the dataset structure.
2. To train the model, run the following command:
   ```bash
   python train.py --epochs 25 --batch-size 32 --data-dir ./data
   ```

### Evaluating the Model

After training, you can evaluate the model on the test dataset by running:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model-path ./models/potato_disease_model.h5 --data-dir ./data/test
```

### Predicting New Images

You can predict new images by running:
```bash
python predict.py --model-path ./models/potato_disease_model.h5 --image-path ./path_to_image.jpg
```

## Model Architecture

The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using TensorFlow/Keras. It includes:
- Convolutional layers to extract features from the leaf images.
- Pooling layers to downsample feature maps.
- Fully connected layers to classify the images into different disease categories.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can find detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations of the results in the `notebooks/evaluation.ipynb` file.

## Results

The model achieves a classification accuracy of X% on the test set, and detailed performance metrics can be found in the results folder.
