## Project Overview
This project is designed to help farmers and agricultural experts monitor the health of potato plants by analyzing leaf images. The objective is to use machine learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to detect diseases like Late Blight, Early Blight, and healthy leaves.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to set up the following environment and install dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/potato-plant-leaf-analysis.git
   cd potato-plant-leaf-analysis
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your dataset of potato plant leaf images in the `data/` folder.
2. Train the model by running:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. After training, you can evaluate the model with:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

4. To predict the health of a new potato leaf image, use:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image_path path/to/leaf_image.jpg
   ```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The dataset for training and testing the model consists of images of potato plant leaves. These images are categorized into healthy leaves and leaves infected with various diseases. You can upload your own dataset or use a publicly available dataset for plant disease detection.

Example dataset sources:
- [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- Custom collected images

## Model Training
The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. The training script, `train_model.py`, processes the dataset, performs data augmentation, and trains the model to predict leaf health.

## Results
Once the model is trained, it is evaluated on a test set, and the accuracy and loss metrics are displayed. The model is saved as `potato_leaf_model.h5`.
